# Java Workflow

For the first 10 labs of this course (until we start using Spring MVC), we'll use this workflow to create, edit, debug, and run our new projects.

1. From the command line, create the directory that will hold your work and `cd` into it.
2. Run `gradle init --type java-(library|application)`, depending on whether you're creating a library or an application.
3. Open IntelliJ with that directory as the root level of the project.
4. Run the code by using the play button; for an `application`, that play button will be in the `Application` class, and for a `library`, the play button will be in the tests.
