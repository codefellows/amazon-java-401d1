## Agenda

- Announcements
- Code review
- Lecture
- Lab intro

## Learning Objectives

- Students will be able to allows users to log in to their accounts, authenticated with Spring Auth.
- Students will be able to use Spring Auth to authorize or restrict users from seeing other users's private data.
- Students will be able to draw a distinction between a user being authenticated (logged in) and being authorized (allowed to see/access) some content.

## Lecture Outline

- Define the four components of what type of resources need to be protected with Auth:
  - Routes - unauthorized users shouldn't be able to access some pages at all.
  - UI - unauthorized users shouldn't see UI like an edit button they don't have permissions to touch unless they were an administrator or owner.
  - Actions - unauthorized users shouldn't be able to perform actions on API endpoints.
  - Server Logic - our application should be able to programmatically determine if a user has authorization to perform certain actions, and execute accordingly.
