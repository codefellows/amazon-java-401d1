# Java Fundamentals
This repo contains the labs for the Code Fellows 401 Java course.

## Basics
This is lab one.

### Main
This file contains a main method which calls three other methods:
* Pluralize
  * This takes a string and an int, and adds an "s" to the end if the int is 0 or > 1.

* FlipNHeads
  * This takes an int _n_ and flips a coin until getting 'Heads' n times in a row.

* Clock
  * This prints the time per second to the console, along with the number of cycles between seconds in Hz.
