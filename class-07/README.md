# Class 7: Interfaces and Variables (and other relationships between classes)

## Agenda

- Announcements?
- Code review
- Daily Systems: Environment variables and the PATH
- Warmup questions
- Lecture
  - What are interfaces, more interfaces
  - Why do we use interfaces
  - How do we use interfaces
- Whiteboarding demo
- Lab intro

## Warmup Questions

1. What's the difference between an interface and a parent class?
2. What are some different relationships that can exist between different classes?
3. What's a `toString` method?
4. What's the output of this code? (predictions, don't run it)

    ```java
    int a = 5;
    int b = a;
    a = 6;
    System.out.println(b);
    ```

5. What's the output of this code? (predictions, don't run it)

    ```java
    int[] nums = new int[]{1,2,3,4};
    int[] moreNums = nums;
    nums[0] = 7;
    System.out.println(moreNums[0]);
    ```

6. What's the output of this code? (predictions, don't run it)

    ```java
    int[] nums = new int[]{1,2,3,4};
    int[] moreNums = nums;
    nums = new int[]{6,7,8,9};
    System.out.println(moreNums[0]);
    ```

7. Why does that make any sense?

### Lists vs. ArrayLists vs. LinkedLists

Which should you use? Why?
