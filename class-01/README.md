# Class 1: Kickoff and Intro to Java

Welcome to Day 1 of Code 401: Java! We're excited to have you here. Today's focus will be on reviewing the basics from the prework and ensuring you have the basic development tools that you'll need to succeed in this course.

* [Java Tutorial Hello World](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/index.html)

## Agenda
- Welcome, introductions
- Overview of Slack, Canvas, GitHub
- Review of Git workflow
- Overview of Java variables, classes, objects
- Review of the `main` method
- Overview of code challenges
- Walkthrough of repo setup for today's work
- Lab intro

## Git and GitHub Warmup
1. Draw a diagram of how git and GitHub work. Include your computer and GitHub (in the cloud), each of which has both a master branch and a feature branch. Include arrows for how the code moves when performing each of these actions:
  - add
  - commit
  - push
  - clone
  - pull
  - pull request
  - checkout
2. Write an English description of your Git workflow: when you start working, what do you do? Where do you do your work, and what do you do as you're working and when you've finished your work for the day?

## Java Warmup
1. Write down the things that feel the most different between JavaScript and Java based on your experience with the prework.
2. What data types do we have in Java?
3. What happens when we write bad code in JavaScript? What about in Java?
